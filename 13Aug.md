# Empirical Approaches in Cognitive Science
## Signal Detection Theory (contd.)
SDT is meant to analyze decision-making under uncertainty using a precise mathematical language.

## N-Back Experiment (Capacity of Working Memory)
The study of probing behaviour experimentally is called psychophysics.

An example of an experiment is the n-back experiment, meant to test working memory, in which the subject needs to recall the nth previous letter in a continuous stream of letters (shown one at a time).

## Nature of Working Memory
[zoned out during the experiment design]
THis experiment found that working memory is better conceived of as a small set of discrete fixed-resolution representations.

Various quantities can be extracted from the distribution of guesses – the standard deviation corresponds to the precision, and the height of the graph to something else that I missed.

# Beyond Laboratory Research
The ecological validitiy of many experiments can be called into question, as the link between the experiments and the cognitive hypotheses is often tenuous. It can be established with more certainty by conducting an analogous study in realistic conditions.
