# Theories of Consciousness
## Higher-Order Theories
The cognitive processes in the brain occur at two levels: lower- and higher-order. The *target* of the meta-representation (or higher-order representation) is the lower-order representation. Higher-order theories deal with this level of processing.

## Global Workspace Theories
This type of theory suggests that there is a *workspace* where relevant information is stored for cognitive processing (in the frontal part of the brain), and from which it is then broadcast into several regions across the brain, in a process called *ignition*.

## Integrated Information Theory
This theory posits some axioms with causal connections, through which the system produces information that is larger than the sum of its parts. A quantity called *irreducible information* is associated with this system; if it is nonzero, we call the system conscious.

## Predictive Coding Theories
These theories hypothesize that *feedback* connections allow for the HO representations to affect the way lower-order representations are created and processed. This explains why phenomenal experiences differ from person to person.

# Empirical Approaches in Cognitive Science
In order to gather data to evaluate theories in cognitive science, there are mainly two types of methods – behavioral and neural. The theories listed above all use neuronal data to substantiate their predictions.

## Differences in Perception of Stimuli
An example of an empirical law in cognitive science is Weber's Law, which states that the JND (*just noticeable difference*) is a constant fraction of the standard stimulus, across all levels of intensity (except high- and low-intensity regimes).

Fechner developed a concept of units of *internal response*, which are the difference between two signals that are just noticeably different. From this, he hypothesised that the perceived sensation $s(x)$ of a stimulus with intensity $x$ is proportional to $\log(x)$.
